    "text": "Welcome\nThis repository contains a review of Global in-situ Observations & Measurements networks and data sets, and a number of compiled and analysis ready point (spatial) data sets that can be used for training global spatial prediction models or similar analysis. It is has been developed within the OpenLandMap.org platform and its main objective is to support a more reproducible and a more collaborative global modeling and analysis of environmental and Earth System Science variables. We focus on meteorological variables (Sparks, Hengl, and Nelson 2017), land cover and vegetation observations (Fritz et al. 2017; Hengl et al. 2018), plant roots (Iversen et al. 2018) and plant traits (Kattge et al. 2020), soil variables (Batjes et al. 2017; Hengl et al. 2017; Panagos et al. 2017), water dynamics (Pena Luque 2018), and measurements of fluxes and ecosystem services (Ukkola et al. 2017; Kulmala 2018; Jian et al. 2020), although the list will be continuously updated and extended.\nFor practical purposes, we have organized the monitoring networks and data sets around the following themes (based on the UN-GGIM The Global Fundamental Geospatial Data Themes): - Buildings and Settlements, - Elevation and Depth, - Geology and Soils, - Land Cover and Land Use, - Population Distribution, - Water, - Physical Infrastructure, - Climate (added entry), - Biodiversity and Nature Conservation (added entry),",

If you discover an issue with license, data description or version number of a dataset, please open a Github issue.\nRecommended settings for all datasets are:\n\nPeer-reviewed versions of the datasets (i.e. a dataset accompanied with a peer-reviewed publication) should have the priority,\n\nRegister your dataset (use e.g. https://zenodo.org) and assign a DOI to each version,\n\nProvide enough metadata so that it can be imported and bind with other data without errors,\n\nIf your dataset is a compilation of previously published datasets, please indicate in the description,\n\nInformation outdated or missing? Please open an issue or best do a correction and then a pull request.",

We specifically promote publishing and sharing of Open Geographical and Geoscientific Data, using and developing Open Source Software and encouraging and empowering under-represented researchers e.g. those from ODA recipient countries and female researchers. We believe that the key measure of quality of research in all sciences (and especially in geographical information sciences) is in transparency and reproducibility of the computer code used to generate results (read more in: “Everyone has a right to know what is happening with the planet”).\nOpenLandMap represents data (global land mass), services and web-apps providing access and interactive visualizations of the Terabytes of high resolution data (1-km, 250-m, 100-m, 30-m or finer) produced by the OpenGeoHub Foundation and/or contributing organizations.\nOpenLandMap is an Open Land Data project, mainly inspired by the OpenStreetMap project: you are free to use OpenLandMap data for any purpose as long as you credit OpenLandMap and its contributors.
