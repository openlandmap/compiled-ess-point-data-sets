    "text": "This repository contains a review of Global in-situ Observations & Measurements networks and data sets, and a number of compiled and analysis ready point (spatial) data sets that can be used for training global spatial prediction models or similar analysis. It is has been developed within the OpenLandMap.org platform and its main objective is to support a more reproducible and a more collaborative global modeling and analysis of environmental and Earth System Science variables. We focus on meteorological variables (Sparks, Hengl, and Nelson 2017), land cover and vegetation observations (Fritz et al. 2017; Hengl et al. 2018), plant roots (Iversen et al. 2018) and plant traits (Kattge et al. 2020), soil variables (Batjes et al. 2017; Hengl et al. 2017; Panagos et al. 2017), water dynamics (Pena Luque 2018), and measurements of fluxes and ecosystem services (Ukkola et al. 2017; Kulmala 2018; Jian et al. 2020), although the list will be continuously updated and extended.\n\nIf your work / products are cited here, you are for us a champion of open environmental data and we are enormously thankful for your contributions (please never stop!).\nFor practical purposes, we have organized the monitoring networks and data sets around the following themes (based on the UN-GGIM The Global Fundamental Geospatial Data Themes):\n\nBuildings and Settlements,\nElevation and Depth,\nGeology and Soils,\nLand Cover and Land Use,\nPopulation Distribution,\nWater,\nPhysical Infrastructure,\nClimate (added entry),\nBiodiversity and Nature Conservation (added entry),\n\nWe also distinguish between three main types of global data sets:\n\nGlobal Permanent Monitoring Networks: here we only consider monitoring networks that still collect in-situ Observations & Measurements and where the data is imported, quality controlled and served by a national or international organization.\nGlobal (original) reference data sets: these are original data sets usually produced by a single group or project (hence NOT compilations!) that are global, but no new data is added these can NOT be classified as monitoring networks.\nGlobal compilations of data sets: these are combinations of data from various sources combined / bind together to produce a single analysis-ready data set; can be considered of lowest quality from the three types listed.\n\n\n\nCompiled data (imported, standardized, quality-controlled) is available through a diversity of standard formats:\n\nCSV file (compressed using giz to reduce download time);\nRDS file (native R data format);\nGPKG file (Geopackage file ready to be opened in QGIS);\n\nAll files can be downloaded from the /out directory.\n\n\n\nThe minimum requirements to submit a dataset for inclusion to the OpenLandMap repository are:\n\nGlobal coverage (or at least aiming at the global coverage) AND,\n\nLicense and terms of use clearly specified AND,\n\nComplete and consistent metadata that can ensure correct standardization and harmonization steps AND,\n\nAt least 50 unique spatial locations AND,\n\nNo broken or invalid URLs,\n\nData sets that do NOT satisfy the above listed minimum requirements might be removed. If you discover an issue with license, data description or version number of a dataset, please open a Github issue.\nRecommended settings for all datasets are:\n\nPeer-reviewed versions of the datasets (i.e. a dataset accompanied with a peer-reviewed publication) should have the priority,\n\nRegister your dataset (use e.g. https://zenodo.org) and assign a DOI to each version,\n\nProvide enough metadata so that it can be imported and bind with other data without errors,\n\nIf your dataset is a compilation of previously published datasets, please indicate in the description,\n\nInformation outdated or missing?
