# Welcome {.unnumbered}

This repository contains a review of Global in-situ Observations & Measurements networks 
and data sets, and a number of compiled and analysis ready point (spatial) data sets that 
can be used for training global spatial prediction models or similar analysis. It is has been 
developed within the [OpenLandMap.org](https://openlandmap.github.io/book/) platform and its main objective is [**to support a more reproducible and a more collaborative global modeling and analysis of environmental and Earth System Science variables**](https://opengeohub.org/about-openlandmap/). 
We focus on meteorological variables [@sparks2017gsodr], land cover and vegetation observations 
[@Fritz2017SD; @hengl2018global], plant roots [@FRED2018] and plant traits [@kattge2020try], 
soil variables [@batjes2017wosis; @hengl2017soilgrids250m; @panagos2017global], water 
dynamics [@pena2018synergies], and measurements of fluxes and ecosystem services [@ukkola2017fluxnetlsm; @kulmala2018build; @essd-2020-136], 
although the list will be continuously updated and extended. 

For practical purposes, we have organized the monitoring networks and data sets around the following themes 
(based on the [UN-GGIM The Global Fundamental Geospatial Data Themes](https://ggim.un.org/meetings/GGIM-committee/9th-Session/documents/Fundamental_Data_Publication.pdf)):
- Buildings and Settlements,
- Elevation and Depth,
- Geology and Soils,
- Land Cover and Land Use,
- Population Distribution,
- Water,
- Physical Infrastructure,
- Climate (_added entry_),
- Biodiversity and Nature Conservation (_added entry_),

## Download compiled data {.unnumbered}

Compiled data (imported, standardized, quality-controlled) is available 
through a diversity of standard formats:

- CSV file (compressed using giz to reduce download time);
- RDS file (native R data format);
- GPKG file ([Geopackage file](https://www.geopackage.org/) ready to be opened in QGIS);

All files can be downloaded from the `/out` [directory](https://github.com/openlandmap/compiled-ess-point-data-sets/-/tree/master/out).

## Add your own data {.unnumbered}

The minimum requirements to submit a dataset for inclusion to [the
OpenLandMap repository](https://github.com/openlandmap/) are:

-   **Global coverage** (or at least aiming at the global coverage) AND,\
-   License and terms of use clearly specified AND,\
-   Complete and consistent metadata that can ensure correct
    standardization and harmonization steps AND,\
-   At least 50 unique spatial locations AND,\
-   No broken or invalid URLs,

Data sets that do NOT satisfy the above listed minimum requirements might be
removed. If you discover an issue with license, data description or
version number of a dataset, please open a [Github
issue](https://github.com/openlandmap/compiled-ess-point-data-sets/issues).

Recommended settings for all datasets are:

-   Peer-reviewed versions of the datasets (i.e. a dataset accompanied
    with a peer-reviewed publication) should have the priority,\
-   Register your dataset (use e.g. <https://zenodo.org>) and assign a DOI
    to each version,\
-   Provide enough metadata so that it can be imported and bind with
    other data without errors,\
-   If your dataset is a compilation of previously published datasets, please 
    indicate in the description,

Information outdated or missing? Please open an issue or best do a
correction and then a [pull
request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).

## About OpenGeoHub {.unnumbered}

[<img src="./images/opengeohub_logo_ml.png" alt="OpenGeoHub logo" width="350"/>](https://opengeohub.org)

**OpenGeoHub foundation** is a not-for-profit research foundation
located in Wageningen, the Netherlands. We specifically promote
publishing and sharing of Open Geographical and Geoscientific Data,
using and developing Open Source Software and encouraging and empowering
under-represented researchers e.g. those from ODA recipient countries
and female researchers. We believe that the key measure of quality of
research in all sciences (and especially in geographical information
sciences) is in transparency and reproducibility of the computer code
used to generate results (read more in: ["Everyone has a right to know what is happening with the planet"](https://opengeohub.medium.com/)).

[OpenLandMap](https://openlandmap.github.io/book/) represents data (global land mass), services and web-apps providing 
access and interactive visualizations of the Terabytes of high resolution data 
(1-km, 250-m, 100-m, 30-m or finer) produced by the OpenGeoHub Foundation 
and/or contributing organizations. 

[OpenLandMap](https://openlandmap.github.io/book/) is an Open Land Data project, mainly inspired by the [OpenStreetMap](https://openstreetmap.org) 
project: you are free to use OpenLandMap data for any purpose as long as you 
credit OpenLandMap and its contributors. If you alter or build upon the data 
in certain ways, you may distribute the result only under the same licence.
