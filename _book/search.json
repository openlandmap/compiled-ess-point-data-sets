We focus on meteorological variables (Sparks, Hengl, and Nelson 2017), land cover and vegetation observations (Fritz et al. 2017; Hengl et al. 2018), plant roots (Iversen et al. 2018) and plant traits (Kattge et al. 2020), soil variables (Batjes et al. 2017; Hengl et al. 2017; Panagos et al. 2017), water dynamics (Pena Luque 2018), and measurements of fluxes and ecosystem services (Ukkola et al. 2017; Kulmala 2018; Jian et al. 2020), although the list will be continuously updated and extended.\nFor practical purposes, we have organized the monitoring networks and data sets around the following themes (based on the UN-GGIM The Global Fundamental Geospatial Data Themes): - Buildings and Settlements, - Elevation and Depth, - Geology and Soils, - Land Cover and Land Use, - Population Distribution, - Water, - Physical Infrastructure, - Climate (added entry), - Biodiversity and Nature Conservation (added entry),"

    "text": "About OpenGeoHub\n\nOpenGeoHub foundation is a not-for-profit research foundation located in Wageningen, the Netherlands. We specifically promote publishing and sharing of Open Geographical and Geoscientific Data, using and developing Open Source Software and encouraging and empowering under-represented researchers e.g. those from ODA recipient countries and female researchers. We believe that the key measure of quality of research in all sciences (and especially in geographical information sciences) is in transparency and reproducibility of the computer code used to generate results (read more in: “Everyone has a right to know what is happening with the planet”).\nOpenLandMap represents data (global land mass), services and web-apps providing access and interactive visualizations of the Terabytes of high resolution data (1-km, 250-m, 100-m, 30-m or finer) produced by the OpenGeoHub Foundation and/or contributing organizations.\nOpenLandMap is an Open Land Data project, mainly inspired by the OpenStreetMap project: you are free to use OpenLandMap data for any purpose as long as you credit OpenLandMap and its contributors. If you alter or build upon the data in certain ways, you may distribute the result only under the same licence. See the Copyright and License page for details."
