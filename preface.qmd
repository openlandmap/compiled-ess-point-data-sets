## Who this book is for

This repository contains a review of Global in-situ Observations & Measurements 
networks and data sets, and a number of compiled and analysis ready point (spatial) 
data sets that can be used for training global spatial prediction models or similar 
analysis. It is has been developed within the www.OpenLandMap.org and Open-Earth-Monitor 
Cyberinfrastructure projects (https://earthmonitor.org). The main objective of this 
compendium is to support a more reproducible and a more collaborative global modeling 
and analysis of environmental and Earth System Science variables.

## Compiled data sets

We provide code and examples of how to generate so-called **Analysis-Ready training 
data sets**. Some minimum conditions for a data set to be analysis ready include:

-  It requires no special pre-processing to remove artifacts, harmonize values within columns, bind or subset data;
-  It comes with extensive metadata so that there is no mistake about how was the data collected, prepared and distributed and by whom;
-  It is ready in some standard format e.g. GeoPackage or GeoParquet; we recommend using **(open) cloud-native data formats** to distribute data (especially for large data) either [Geoparquet](https://geoparquet.org/) / [Flatgeobuf](https://flatgeobuf.org/) and similar;
